Key Pair:
---------

Key-Pair Name: ashishkg-key-pair-oregon
file-name : ashishkg-key-pair-oregon.pem

If you will use an SSH client on a Mac or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.

$ chmod 400 ashishkg-key-pair-oregon.pem


Connecting to our Linux Instance from Windows:
----------------------------------------------

If we use putty to connect to our Linux instance we need to convert the .pem file to .ppk file.
There is procedure using puttyGem.

VPC:
----

Supported Platforms : VPC
Default VPC : vpc-851cc3e1

Create a Security Group:
------------------------

Security groups act as a firewall for associated instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
Security groups are specific to a region, so you should select the same region in which you created your key pair.

Security group: ashishkg_SG_oregon
description: My security group.

Adding Rule to SG: Added SSH rule with Source as Custom IP Address: What is my IP(Public).

Connecting through Putty:
-------------------------
DNS: ec2-52-38-250-254.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
	 ec2-52-38-8-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
	 ec2-52-36-211-16.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Instance Id : i-76a442b0
			  i-76a442b0

HostName : ec2-user@ec2-52-38-250-254.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
		   ec2-user@ec2-52-38-8-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
		   ec2-user@ec2-52-36-211-16.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Port	 : 22 
Expand Connection, expand SSH, and then select Auth --> .ppk file that you generated for your key pair, and then click Open.
After Connected : [ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-179 ~]$

PSCP File transfer:
-------------------

The following example transfers the file Sample_file.txt from a Windows computer to the /usr/local directory on a Linux instance:

C:\> pscp -i C:\Keys\my-key-pair.ppk C:\Sample_file.txt user_name@public_dns:/usr/local/Sample_file.txt

C:\> pscp -i C:\Ashish\Documents\personal\docs\2016CheckList\April\aws\ashishkg-key-pair-oregon.ppk C:\Ashish\Sample.txt ec2-user@ec2-52-38-250-254.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/usr/local/Sample.txt

To use PSCP, set path=C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty

cmd: --> enter pscp. If it shows output then you are good to run the above command.
