Additional Information:
-----------------------

1. Deploy a static website – Host your static website using the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
2. Associate your domain name with your website – You can use Amazon Route 53 to tell the Domain Name System (DNS) where to find the resources for your domain, such as your website content in Amazon S3.
3. Speed up your website – Use Amazon CloudFront to create a content delivery network (CDN) that makes your website content available from data centers around the world, called edge locations.


After done with Hands-On delete the bucket to avoid charges.
